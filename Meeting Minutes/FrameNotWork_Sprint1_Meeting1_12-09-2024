# Meeting 1
Date: 12-09-2024
Duration: 100 minutes (during lab)

## Meeting Details:
- Introduction on what the project is about 
- Discussed the general idea of how we wanted the website to work and look like (what languages to use):
> User will have to login using an email and password, if they do not have an account, they will have to sign up by inputing their name, email and password.
> Once they sign in, a web page will display their courses from which they can click on and see their team.
> There, they have the option to click on any teammate and rate them based on the four dimensions or to click on their own rating to view their score.
> Instructors will have a similar layout except for an option to create teams and assign specific students to them.
> They will also have the option to see a list of all the participants of the course.
