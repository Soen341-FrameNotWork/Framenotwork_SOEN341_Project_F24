1. Review of Previous Sprint
- Discussed what we have achieved so far (ex: login system for both student and instructor)
- Since the functionality to create teams and assign students to groups wasn't completed in sprint 1, it will have to be for sprint 2
- Analyzed comments left by the TA during the previous lab and on Moodle, these aspects will have to be improved:
  - More detailed user stories (priority level as labels, due dates)
  - Have tasks as their own issues instead of simply a list in user stories (with estimated efforts)
  - Add acceptance criteria
  - Add a detailed contribution log as a separate file in Excel (with dates and time spent)
  - Add more details to the burndown chart 
  - Create a database diagram

2. Sprint Goals
Define Objectives:
- Implement the functionality for instructors to create teams and assign students to groups (teams visible)
- Develop interfaces for students to select their teammates for evaluation using a 5-point scale for the Cooperation dimension with a Confirm page and optional comment boxes
- If time permits, do the same for Conceptual Contribution, Practical Contribution and Work Ethic
- Make improvements to the project based on the TA's comments mentioned above

3. Task Breakdown
- Observed the sprint plan 2 and assigned tasks to team members: 
  Tymofiy and Jidapa will focus on the documentation (GitHub and Sprint planning) while Bulat, Jeremie, Evan and Mathieu will focus more on implementing the features for this sprint.
